## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Testing would follow a sequence of Unit Testing -> Integration Testing ->  System Testing -> Acceptance Testing.
As for regressive testing this would be done, whenever a new feature or modification is done to the code base. These 4 phases are explained in more detail below:

Unit Testing - here we are testing small pieces of code to check whether they behave as expected. This would allow us to check that the code behaves as expected and to catch errors early. The software developers would carry out unit testing as they change the code base and the tester would carry out their own testing.

Integration Testing - here we are testing whether the modules within our system work well with one another. This testing would be carried out by the tester once a new module is created.

System Testing - here we will put the system through some simulated use cases and check whether the system as a whole satisfies all requirements. This testing would be carried out by the tester once the system has been coded to adequately fulfill all the requirements.

Acceptance Testing - here we will deploy the system to its respective platforms and let the users test the functionality of the system and check whether the system meets all of its requirements.

### 1.2 Test Selection

### Black Box Testing: System Testing
-  The system's functionality would be tested by executing various activities that user can carry out and the result checked against the design specification. Examples:
    - User will sign up for the app.
    - User will login to the app.
    - User will log in and browse for products.
    - User will log in and search for a specific product.
    - An employee user will add a product.
    - An employee user will modify a product.
    - An employee user will delete a product.
- Repeat the above multiple times to fully test the system.
### White Box Testing: Unit Testing
- Specific aspects of the system and individual components of the system are tested and their results checked against the code.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

This is a series of criteria that all tests (unit,integration,system,acceptance) must pass to be accepted.


### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bugs will be handled and solved by the part of the team that worked on the affected portion of the code. Bugs that have a more widespread effect will be worked on by other parts of the team. Enhancement requests will be be discussed with the appropriate part(s) of the team, to make satisfactory changes.

### 1.5 Technology

JUnit, this will be used to handle any unit testing. With the other forms of testing being handled manually, using test cases.
