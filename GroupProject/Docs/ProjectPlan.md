Team 2

## 1 Introduction

We are making a floor app that allows the customers and employees of *Flooring Icon* to interact with the stock of a *Flooring Icon* store. Customers and employees should be able to browse and search for products. Employees should also be able to modify the inventory of a store.


## 2 Process Description

- Inception: In this stage the team starts with an idea of what final the product is. After discussion the team sets boundaries for the project. The team would also produce a list of requirements for the system to fulfill.

    - Entrance Criteria:
    A small design brief or an outline of the general idea for the product. This should give a discernible idea of what the final product should look/behave like.

    - Exit Criteria: We should have a document outlining what we want the prospective product to achieve. In addition there should be a document of requirements for the project and an understanding of what the typical use cases for the product would be.

- Elaboration: In this stage the team would look at the design of the system and fleshout the sort of architecture that would be utilized. At this stage we would agree on a more finalized design for the system.

    - Entrance Criteria: A document that outlines the layout of the product and a list of requirements that the product must meet.
    - Exit Criteria: We should have most of the the uses cases listed and fleshed out. In addition, we should have a document outlining a possible architecture/structure for the project. This structure should be feasible and should meet all the requirements. We should also have a document outlining how the project would be developed. Finally, there should be a document that includes any non-functional requirements for the system.

- Construction: Here the team would essentially implement the design to fulfill all of the requirements. In addition, we would also test code as its produced.
    - Entrance Criteria: A document outlining the structure/architecture of the system. Further documents that list the non-functional requirements and a project development outline.
    - Exit Criteria: A fully built system that meets all of the listed requirements from previous stages. This system doesn't need to meet all the non-functional requirements. In addition a user manual for the client should be also be present.

- Transition: At this stage the team is gradually handing over the completed system to the user. We will also deal with any bugs/problems that are revealed as the user gets acquainted with and starts using the system.
    - Entrance Criteria: A completed system that fulfills all functional and nonfunctional requirements. A user manual that will help the user get acquainted with the system.
    - Exit Criteria: A product that has had its initial teething bugs dealt with. A product that fulfills most if not all of the non-functional requirements identified prior.
